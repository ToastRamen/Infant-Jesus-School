			<h1>IJSIAN Week</h1>
      <p>The 4-day “IJSian Week” was held at Infant Jesus School grounds on January 18-21, 2023 with the student-athletes as the core components in implementing the sports event. The competition of Ball games, E-Sports, and Thinkathlon were the main categories of the tournament.</p>
     <br>
      <p>It served to improve the student’s engagement towards both physical and mind sports as well as to increase the spirit of competitiveness which has subtly subsided in the past years of the pandemic. Coming together to promote “sportsmanship, teamwork, unity, and camaraderie”, the IJSians have proved to remain headstrong in taking on the challenges designated to them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The event was successfully carried out as all the students from different year levels were divided into two teams; Atocha and Aracoeli competed against each other with the aid of their team managers to bring their respective sides victory. From both teams, around 150 participated in the line of ballgames namely Basketball, Volleyball, Badminton, Table Tennis, and Table Soccer, approximately 80 players in mind sports such as board games and brain twisters, and 40 players in E-Sports.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After the event, Team Atocha, which represented the color green was reckoned and declared the Overall Champion. For the complete result of winners for each category, see page 7.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Both the participants and bystanders enjoyed and learned a new lesson, especially the athletes, as they gained experience with the given opportunity to enhance their skills and showcase their performance, achieved with hard work and training.</p>
