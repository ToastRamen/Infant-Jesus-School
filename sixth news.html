    <h1>New Canteen Payment Method</h1>
    <br>
			<p>Are we sure it’s safe to go back? Am I confident enough to attend classes? Will everything be okay? These are real fears and valid questions that many of us share as the new mode of learning is being introduced this school year. </p>
      <br>
      <p>The global economy is anticipated to suffer long-term consequences as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic (World Bank Group, 2020). Specifically, the pandemic has had an immediate impact on education and the student’s experience since face-to-face learning has been replaced by distance learning. Given the abrupt changes in the educational environment, it is crucial to address the students’ concerns regarding their preference, motivation, stress, flexibility, support, and engagement in various teaching methods both during and after the surge of Covid-19. Despite the fluctuating circumstances amidst this global crisis, academic institutions strive to offer their best to learners.</p>
      <br>
      <p> According to The International Journal of Management Education (2021), students feel anxious about the upcoming start of classes due to the implementation of blended learning where instructions done in person and online are combined during the Covid-19 pandemic. After years of isolation and home-based e-learning, finally, attending classes in a physical setting might be overwhelming to some. Understandably, even though we used to be completely adjusted to being in school before the pandemic, we might find it stressful now to be separated and leave our “safe harbor”. On the other hand, compared to online learning, blended learning may consistently be seen by students as a more comprehensive experience. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Students perceive they have been receiving a ‘lesser’ learning experience when F2F is replaced by online learning, emphasizing the lack of hands-on experiences. They also pointed out the importance of direct interaction with other learners and instructors which provides greater clarity and understanding. After all, human contact is vital to enjoying learning—not to mention the important 21st-century skills that are best learned in F2F.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With careful consideration now that the risks are known and somewhat manageable, calculated to fit the criterion of the administered safety measures, the school moves forward with Flexible Learning. Activities on campus—both academic and co-curricular will be considerably different from what they were in the past. Parents’ consent is taken into account, facilities and classrooms are created or modified to fit the new setting, and although not entirely, online activities will still be done. The conduct of extra-curricular activities shall be prohibited according to a directive issued by DepEd but they allowed undertakings such as the Schools Press Conference, Science and Technology Fair, Festival of Talent, and other similar activities which may be conducted in hybrid modality depending on the alert level declared in the area. With the opportunity students now have to be on campus, a lot of educational benefits can be enjoyed and taken advantage of while also working to ensure that everyone stays safe.</p>
      <br>
      <p>  The routine of going to school has been paused for so long it’s reasonable that we might struggle and take a little bit longer to adapt, especially to these blended schedules. But the excitement of going back to school, studying with peers for support, and getting to interact with other learners after so many years will outweigh the potential anxiety students might feel in this situation. Let the excitement lead the charge and always remember that you’re not alone. If you lead with your own anxiety, you’re only going to fuel anxiety. </p>
      <br>
      <p>  Knowing that everyone is trying what they can do to manage the situation and provide reassurance, it is of great relief that we’re all working and going through experiences together. We can all relate, understand, and grow as a generation of proactive students. Think of it as a process of gradually building a new and evolved version of education for the future—and you’re a big part of it. </p>
