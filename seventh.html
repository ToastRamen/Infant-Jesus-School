    <h1>My Dear Fellow IJSIANS</h1>
    <br>
			<p>The start of a new school year can always spark a feeling of excitement and anxiety no matter the setting. Waves of groans and mutters are sometimes heard from reluctant students who have yet to finish their fun on their summer vacations. In the past academic years, for everyone’s safety, distance learning was implemented. Which, somewhere deep down, made some of us cheer for the extended ‘vacation’. Admit it, because I’ve done it as well.</p>
      <br>
      <p> For this school year 2022-2023, IJS has decided to implement a blended mode of learning where we get to learn in a mixed environment of online and face-to-face classes. And amidst the excitement, there are surely some worries that come along with another change of environment. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Distance learning, despite the cons, undoubtedly provided a learning opportunity during a global crisis. We both had lost and gained time; losing time to experience more with others and gaining time to discover more about ourselves, which has been quite a journey. Not to mention, we were also spared the burden of getting up early to take morning showers and join with the crowd in public transport, so that definitely was a plus, right?</p>
      <br>
      <p>Distance learning had been genuinely more relaxed compared to on-site learning, and with the remote setup no longer limiting the learning progress, many can’t help but feel some pressure to excel once again, and in a more competitive environment. After all, we will have to say goodbye to our beloved ‘helpers’ like google when we go back to the classroom, and no longer can we have sudden disconnections when called upon during a discussion. Unless, of course, you are willing to stand up and leave the room when you can’t answer the question. Perhaps that would earn you a nice talk with Ma’am Quimpo at the Guidance Office. </p>
      <br>
      <p>While distance learning did seem to be more relaxed, the pandemic indeed wasn’t kind to all, and it can take time for everyone to adjust and adapt to a changing environment. Communication is also another worry most are troubled by, as the pandemic has certainly created more introverts with minimal social encounters permitted. However, if we are able to adjust to online learning that abruptly came, then I believe we can also adjust back to F2F classes that we had been used to in the past. There are also those who find themselves more compatible with online classes compared to the traditional classroom mode, and it can take even longer to adjust.</p>
      <br>
      <p> Along with other adjustments to our daily routines and sleeping schedules, regardless of how long we stay up at night to play games or chat online, we will eventually have to return to waking up early to take cold showers in the morning—not to mention, with oil prices going up, public fares have also substantially increased, and it’s not like everyone can just walk their way to school to avoid that.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Meanwhile, blended learning will somehow give everybody more time to adjust and naturally adapt to a new change. It is to the best intentions of the school for every student to receive high-quality education and provide an engaging environment well-suited for every student. The school is there for us to learn and study, not to mistreat ourselves in order to reach someone else’s unreasonable expectations. While there are memes about how schools only give their attention to the ‘smartest’ students in class, I do know that every teacher is accommodating to students with different learning capabilities.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Worry not about this school year dear fellow students. The teachers won’t eat you when you make a mistake or have struggled with a certain subject. Just do your best and be cooperative just as they are with you. Learning isn’t a competition, but a process that is taken differently by everyone. So don’t burden yourself with someone else’s progress.</p>
      <br>
      <p> With worries comes excitement. There is definitely a certain touch on f2f that just can’t be replaced by online learning— the joy and liveliness that can only exist in a classroom, having an engaging atmosphere that allows students to learn and understand better with each other and with the teacher present to guide and answer questions. The little banter and sporadic jamming during recess, professional ‘smugglings’ of food during class, sneaky entrances trying to avoid the guard for having no ID, little ‘tsismis’ here and there, special activities and events, IJSian Week, and even PE— surely the things to look forward to outweighs those worries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>  Amidst the excitement for face-to-face classes, a gentle reminder for everyone that COVID19 is still here, alongside the threat of a newly emerged monkeypox. While the restrictions have considerably decreased, everyone should still be cautious at these times. Everyone is reminded to follow and adhere to health protocols at home, at school, and in other public places. Let us do our parts and hope for the best.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Worries and anxieties are inevitable, but don’t let those stop you from enjoying the good things and take away your peace. Hakuna Matata, worry less, take it easy.</p>
      <br>
      <p>   Lastly, I wish everyone a fun, successful, and productive school year. To the new and old IJSians, welcome back to school.</p>
